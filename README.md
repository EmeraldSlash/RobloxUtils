RobloxUtils is a centralized container for reusable code that I find myself needing in many different projects on Roblox.

It is all contained in a single file, so that it can be easily diffed and managed, and to avoid spamming pointless module `require()`s in every piece of code. This is also helpful because much of the reusable code in this module is subject to an awkward trade-off: the reusable code can noticeably simplify and reduce LOC in usage code, however the reusable code itself is often small enough that it's not worth having its own dedicated module. The amount of code added to `require()` these small modules may even negate the LOC reduction benefit the reusable code providess in the first place! So we have a "code economy of scale", where "small code reuse" makes sense only when it is part of one big module.

In addition to many trivial/isolated utilities such as table & array operations, doubly-linked-list operations, and math operations, the module contains some more significant structural utilities such as Maids, Signals, AsyncTasks, Caches, and Anims, as well as some utilities that focus on Roblox APIs such as ContextActionMulti, TextMetrics, SafeAreaMetrics, a RemoteEvent creation helper, and Instance/object creation helpers.
